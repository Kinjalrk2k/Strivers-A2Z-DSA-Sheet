## Step 0: Miscellaneous

- The Bash files `compile.sh` and `compile_run.sh` are useful for running C++ programs easily. Place the functions in your ` ~/.zshrc` (or ` ~/.bashrc`) and invoke them like the following:

```sh
compile skeleton.cpp
compile_run skeleton.cpp
```

- `compile.sh` compiles the C++ code and generates the `.out` file and `compile_run.sh` compiles as well as runs the program
